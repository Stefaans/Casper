# Trelent take-home

This is my submission for the Trelent take-home challenge. The comments below are meant for the Trelent team.

For the assignment and build instructions, see https://github.com/Trelent/trelent-take-home/blob/main/README.md.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Successful completion:
*Does the chat work such that one can have a multi-message conversation with GPT-3.5? Is this true in the Vercel deployment?*\
Yes!

### 2. Code quality & style:
- *Is your code clean, simple, and well-structured?*\
I would like to think so, and would love to discuss my choices.
- *Are you using best practices?*\
Many more improvements are possible, but this was an MVP of sorts.    
- *Is your code adequately documented?*\
I believe the "why" is more important than the "how". That means that less (but good) documentation is  better than more (but poor). I did not use the Trelent plugin to assist with generating documentation.

### 3. Design & responsiveness: 
*Does the chat look good? Is it easy to use? Is it responsive, both to screen size and system dark/light theme? Does it look like a professional product?*\
I think "yes" to all but the forth requirement. A professional product from Trelent will have a skillful designer on the team, and sufficient development time to implement a polished design.   

### 4. Resourcefulness:
*Did you find your own resources to help you complete the project? Were those resources up-to date and relevant?*\
Yes, I think I did.

## Notes
The Vercel app uses my own OpenAI API key. You may destroy the key your supplied to me.
